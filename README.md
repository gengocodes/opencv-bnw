## About

This project is a simple command-line tool written in Python that utilizes the OpenCV library to convert color images into black and white (grayscale). It provides a quick and easy way to process images, making it suitable for users who need basic image manipulation without complex software. The tool is designed to be straightforward and accessible, requiring minimal setup and coding knowledge.

The primary purpose of this tool is to offer a convenient solution for converting images to grayscale. It targets users who need to quickly prepare images for further processing, analysis, or archiving, such as students, researchers, and hobbyists. By leveraging OpenCV, the tool ensures compatibility with various image formats and provides a reliable conversion process.

The project is built using Python and OpenCV. It follows a simple script-based architecture, where the main script takes an input image path and an output image path as arguments. The script then loads the image using OpenCV, converts it to grayscale, and saves the resulting image to the specified output path. The tool's simplicity and reliance on widely used technologies make it easy to understand, modify, and extend.
